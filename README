Ui Helpers
==========

- Short decription:

"The UI Helpers repository contains non-widget based ui classes that are useful for those who intend to develop applications
using Qt5/QtQuick 2 but do not want to depend on QtWidgets - mainly desktop applications. Examples of classes are QUndoCommand,
QAction, QFileSystemModel, etc."

Suggestions and contributions are welcome - contact us on the development@qt-project.org
